How I did it:

The Ground: 
I followed the tutorial to create the spiky mountain shader and assigned it to a plane.
After all the operations instructed by the tutorial I added the position difference from the center to the displacement to create a "valley".
I also assigned the cells output from the vornoi noise to the albedo channel to create an abstract terrain texture.

The water:
I just reduced the speed of the waves and changed its color to red.

Lighting: 
I added a cookie texture to manipulate the color of the directional light.

Particle Effects:
I added a particle effect to create black particles raining from the sky.

Props: 
I found some props on the asset store for free and used them to create a scene.
