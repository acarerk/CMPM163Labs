##Cubes
For the first cube, I interpolated between red, green, blue and pink using my own shader. I also modified it to have deeper shadows.
The second cube is a MeshPhoneMaterial with the color blue and it is transparent.
The third cube is a MeshLambertMaterial with the color yellow.
The last cube is an interpolation of two colors with a custom shader.
