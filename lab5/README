Blue particle effects: Changed the color of the particle effect from the tutorial. Also, played with emmision  values, volume, gravity etc. to make it more of a "spark" effect.
Ghost Player: Changed the player material to glass and played changed the transparency to make a ghost rider(not nicholas cage)
Gold Cart: Changed the cart material to metallic copper and played with the material values to create a "golden cart".
